### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
**Q1. Who coordinates the semester exchange programs?**<br> 
The International Relations Office of IITR coordinates the Semester Exchange. IR Cell is a student body that assists IR Office and provides information about student exchange programs and scholarships. The programs are of two kinds:
- Through applications managed by the International Relations Office (IR Office)
- Through applications sent directly to the Partner Institute

Details about the various programs offered can be found on the website of the IR department.

**Q2. What arrangements are made by IIT Roorkee or the host university?**<br>
Usually, the host institutes provide basic accommodation and food. Suppose a student is a part of a scholarship program, the host institute assists with the trip’s expenses. In some other programs, the students are given a base stipend amount, and it’s up to them how they wish to spend it, provided the expenses are made for the program. However, the specifics of these arrangements depend on the host university.

**Q3. Does the IR cell help out in the application for Visa and communication with the host university?**<br>
The student is primarily responsible for the visa application process. However, the IR cell is involved in communication with the host university.

**Q4. Are there any associated scholarships?**<br>
While most universities have their scholarships associated with the Semester Exchange programs, there are other special scholarships like the Charpak Scholarship or the DUO-India Fellowship. These scholarships can be lump-sum covering most expenses, including air travel, accommodation, and food, or in a stipend format. 

**Q5. When and how to apply?**<br>
Most universities call for registration for the spring semester in September-December and the winter semester in March-May. 
Documents required for most applications include:
- Statement of Purpose
- Scanned copy of passport 
- Curriculum Vitae
- Transcripts
- Recommendation Letter/Referrals from professors of IITR
- DAPC approved list of courses to be taken at the host university

The selection criteria include your Statement of Purpose, while some universities also consider GPA. Additionally, the applicants must apply for their visa as soon as they receive their application confirmation to account for processing time.
The IR Office creates a portal for uploading these documents on its website.

**Q6. How are courses and credits evaluated? Why must the chosen subjects be DAPC approved?**<br>
Generally, the credits of that particular semester of the host college are transferred to IITR. However, this semester’s grades are not taken into account in calculating the final CGPA on graduation. Students ought to ensure that they have gained all the credits specified for their undergraduate/postgraduate program. However, the specifics of credit transfer depend upon the program and host institute.

Before going, the student has to submit a student agreement to IITR, where credits are mentioned. The student agreement document is the DAPC approval of selected courses required by the academic section to transfer credits. DAPC makes sure that the programs chosen by you at the host university are identical/similar to the courses offered at IITR for that particular semester so that the student does not miss out on the academic skills necessary for continuing your program. 

**Q7. What should we do if we come across any semester exchange on our own? What is the modus operandi for that?**<br>
IITR has [<span style="color:blue"><u>MoUs</u></span>](https://ir.iitr.ac.in/MoUs) signed with 78 institutions, but all the available programs with partner universities are challenging to be noticed. Hence, we encourage all the students to be on the lookout for any international Semester Exchange or other programs they are interested in (Specifically, the ones involving universities with which IIT Roorkee has an MOU signed). If you come across a program you would like to pursue; you can email [<span style="color:blue"><u>Dr. Pushpa</u></span>](mailto:pushpa.ir@sric.iitr.ac.in) (Executive Officer managing Exchange Programmes and Agreements). The IR Office would validate whether the program is beneficial to the student or not, an institute-wide email would be sent, and the usual procedures would be followed. 
We would like to request the IR Office and IR Cell to increase the frequency of the notifications for different programs and give a broader time window for uploading the various documents.
