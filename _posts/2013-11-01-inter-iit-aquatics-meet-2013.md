excerpt: IITR's performance in Inter IIT Aquatics meet, 2013
---
The Inter IIT Aquatics meet proved to be extremely rewarding for the women’s team as they bagged five gold medals and one silver contributing a lion’s share in the final points tally. Nivedita Sharma deserves a special mention for her terrific performance as she won all four strokes and 100m freestyle medals for which she was awarded the best swimmer’s trophy among the ladies. IITR managed to secure the women’s championship for the third time in a row with 32 points. Having won the trophy thrice now, IITR now owns the trophy  making this victory a special one. IITB followed very closely with 29 points but the R’s better endurance and nerves prevailed over B.

Male swimmers on show elicited disappointment, leaving the audience confounded especially after the brilliant performance by the girls. The water polo team painted a sorrowful picture, bidding adieu in the first round itself, having been at the receiving end of a sound thumping. The talk of the town, however  was  the rumoured Asian games participant, Akshay Krishna of IITM, who lived up to the hype, breaking all existing records with impeccable ease. (5 golds in individual events and 2 golds in team relay). The tussle for the championship resulted in IIT KGP locking horns with Madras, with the guys down south emerging victorious by a margin of 3 points. (KGP-50; M- 53). Jacob Mathew who stood tall amidst ruins deserves high praise. He was the only medal winner among the men (gold in 100m butterfly) in what was his swansong appearance for IITR. His tally of 11 medals during his 4 year tenure with the team scripts a legacy in itself.

The focus now turns to December when Inter IIT Sports Meet takes place in IITG, with the hope that R improves on last year’s 3rd position to bag the general championship.
