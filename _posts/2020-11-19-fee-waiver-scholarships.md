### Fee Waiver to Economically Weaker students:
On the basis of income proof provided in the current assessment year, UG students are given tuition fee waiver:
1. Full Tuition Fee Waiver. (Economically backward students having family income less than Rs. 1 lac per annum)
2. 2/3 Tuition Fee Waiver (Economically backward students having family income between Rs. 1 lac and Rs. 5 lacs per annum).

### Merit Cum Means Scholarship:
An MCM scholarship beneficiary UG student gets tuition fee waiver and Rs. 1000 per month for 10 months. All students whose family income is less than Rs. 1,00,000 per annum get full fee waiver while students whose family income is between Rs. 1,00,000 and Rs. 5,00,000 per annum get 2/3rd fee waiver. MCM is given to General/OBC category students who fulfil the following conditions:
1. Gross Income of parents (Father/Mother/Both) for the previous financial year is not more than Rs. 5,00,000/- per annum. 
2. CGPA and YGPA should be more than 7.00. 
3. All registered courses should have been cleared. 
4. Available only for the normal duration of the program. For dual degree students, it will be available only up to the 4th year. 
5. The student should not have been penalized for unfair means/ indiscipline. 
6. Available for up to 25% of the actual strength of the class. 
For new students, JEE-Adv or JAM AIR, whichever is applicable, will be the criterion. In subsequent years, their academic performance in the preceding academic year will be the criterion. ITR (Income Tax Return) of the parents (both mother and father) of the current assessment year will be used as proof of income. A student whose family income falls below the prescribed limit at any point during the course of his/her program is eligible to be considered for an award of MCM scholarship from the next academic year.

### Free Messing
Students belonging to the SC/ST category are eligible for this scholarship, given their family’s annual income is less than Rs. 5,00,000. 
The students are awarded free messing (only basic menu) and a pocket allowance of Rs. 250 per month as well as exemption from payment of the hostel room rent. In case the student does not seek free messing he can instead opt for a pocket allowance of Rs. 1000 per month. 

**Note-** There is a 100% fee waiver on tuition fees for SC/ST and PwD students regardless of family income. This will be done automatically at the time of admission. 


### How to apply for these scholarships?:
The forms for these scholarships are made available on awards.iitr.ac.in/scholarship , so students are advised to regularly check the website for updates and to not miss out on the desired scholarship.
The scholarships are active for a complete academic year. Hence, they need to be filled up every year to avail the benefits.
You will need to upload a scanned copy of the ITR of the current assessment year and the PAN cards of your parents/guardians. There will be dedicated fields in the form to upload the required documents, so any changes in the documents required will be taken care of.

**Note for fee waiver –** During the initial admission for the first semester of a student, they will have to pay the full fee. After the admission procedure is complete, the Fee Waiver form will be made available on the website mentioned above. Students will have to fill that form and if the waiver is granted, the amount will be refunded to them. However, for subsequent years, the form will be filled beforehand; hence they won’t have to submit the full fee and will be able to pay the reduced fee during the academic registration.
### How to know if you’ve been granted the scholarship?
The SCSP releases various lists on the Channel i Notice Board, consisting of names of students who have been selected for the scholarship. Applicants should regularly check back to see if their name has arrived in one of those lists. In case of any doubts, SCSP should be contacted directly. 
### How to get the scholarship amount (in case of MCM) and excess fee deposit refund (in case of Fee Waiver)?
When filling out the forms, you will be asked to submit your email ID. Keep this ID handy, because an email will be sent to it (each for MCM and Fee Waiver), wherein a link to a form will be attached. This form has to be filled, giving details such as bank account number and so on, and the refund/scholarship will be deposited in a few working days.
