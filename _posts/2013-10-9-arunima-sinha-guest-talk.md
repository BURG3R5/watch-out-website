It is very easy to lose touch with the real world during our stay in the campus of R. Protected from the negative elements of real world, behind the walls of a national institute, many tend to forget about the evils still existing in the Indian society.

On 9th October Arunima Sinha, a national level volleyball player, delivered a lecture on “Triumph of Willpower atop the Mt. Everest.” This may not sound impressive if you take a look at the incredibly long list of Everest conquerors but she isn’t like the majority. In 2011, Ms Sinha was pushed out of a running train when she tried to resist an attempted robbery. One of her legs had to be amputated below the knee as a result. Despite the injury, she resolved to climb the Mt Everest and in the process she achieved the distinction of being the first lady amputee to climb the Everest.

Before delivering her lecture, Ms. Sinha met the kids of Anushruti, the school for the differently abled. The children welcomed her warmly with excitement. She was delighted to meet them and appreciated their talent and the display of their creative works.

Ms Sinha mentioned in her lecture that she was determined to fight for the rights of women and physically disabled along with the less fortunate children. In very little time she connected with the students and narrated how irrespective of the struggle she had to face in her path, she managed to attain her resolved goal.
