COVID-19 has impacted all of us in several ways. A lot of us are facing the scourge of the financial issues that have come packed with this pandemic. Watch Out! brings to you the various modes of financial assistance the institution provides to help students affected by the pandemic. 

Currently, the Institute provides three modes of financial assistance. This includes the medical insurance coverage we pay for every semester, a fund-raiser through IMEFC (Institute Medical Emergency Fund Committee), and lastly the COVID 19 relief fund made possible through donations from our alumni, led by the Encore platform managed by the 1989 batch. Below mentioned are the various eligibility criteria, methods as well as the amounts of claims that can be made by the students.
