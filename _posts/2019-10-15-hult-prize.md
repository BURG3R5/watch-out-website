The Hult Prize is an annual, year-long competition that crowd-sources ideas from MBA and college students after challenging them to solve a pressing social issue around topics such as food security, water access, energy, and education.

2. Refugees – Re-awakening Human Potential

3. Crowded Urban Spaces

4. Early Childhood Education

5. The Global Food Crisis


This initiative is open to students of all colleges and universities from across the world, making it one of the biggest student-centered events of its kind. It is one of the world’s biggest engines for the launch of for-good, for-profit startups emerging from universities around the world. Each year thousands of college and university students from 150+ countries participate, and since its inception, participants have represented 1,000+ institutions of higher education. In 2018, 115,000 students from over 100 countries competed for the coveted Hult Prize.

How The Wheels Are Set In Motion:

Each year the announcement of the topic sets heralds the arrival of the competition. Every year a new area is chosen to be explored (for the challenge), with the primary criteria for topics being “transformative and sustainable business”.
 
**<u>The Hult Prize takes place in 4 stages :</u>**

## Stage 1: On Campus


The On-Campus Program brings the prize directly to universities around the world. The local championship gives the university’s winning team the chance to bypass the general round, and guarantees a direct entry into one of the regional finals.
 A student who participated in the Hult Prize Challenge 2019 told us, “ The On Campus round mainly consists of pitching your idea to a panel, along with a presentation which summarizes your work plan. The round also gives you an opportunity to get a general idea about how the other participants have tackled the issue and what various strategies are being implemented in solving the challenge at hand.”


## Stage 2: Regionals


The Hult Prize Regionals is a National Level Competition held in March. Regionals takes place in 17 countries including India, Japan, China, Belgium, UK, etc. From the 100,000 students who compete initially, only 5,000 snag a seat at these 2-day regional summits. The Top 50 Hult Prize startups qualify to the next round.

## Stage 3: Accelerator


The very best startups represented at each regional summit secure a spot in the world’s largest accelerators for impact in Boston, Massachusetts and Hult’s castle in the UK.
The startups spend six weeks in the accelerator. There the participants are mentored and undergo a tailor made 5-week program, that focuses on team building, sales, marketing and resource mapping.

## Stage 4: Global Finals


The Global Finals are hosted by the United Nations in New York. Selected teams from the Hult Accelerator program get a chance to present their ideas to the jury which generally consists of UN representatives, previous winners of the Hult Prize, politicians, and CEOs of Non-Governmental organizations working in fields related to that year’s topic, during the Global Finals in September.
