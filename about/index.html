<div>Watch Out! is the official campus news body of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee run by students under the aegis of the Dean of Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy (SRIC), IIT Roorkee. 24 years after its conception, Watch Out! has grown to offer news and commentary from around the campus on its website in conjunction with a semesterly print issue.</div>

<h2>History</h2>

<div>Founded in 1993, we trace our roots back to an attractive looking poster pinned to Govind Bhawan’s notice board. Started off by two entrepreneurial third-year students of the erstwhile University of Roorkee, our first issue was the handiwork of a humble team consisting of seven people and was printed under the kind patronage of Govind Bhawan’s Warden.</div>
