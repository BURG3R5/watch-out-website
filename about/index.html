<div>Watch Out! is the official student media body of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee run entirely by students under the aegis of the Dean of Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy (SRIC), IIT Roorkee. 26 years after its conception, Watch Out! has grown to offer news, commentary, opinions and editorials from around the campus on its website and social media platforms in conjunction with a semesterly print issue.</div>

<h2>History</h2>

<div>The brainchild of two enterprising third-years Anurag Gupta & Harjeet Khanduja, Watch Out! was born from the desire to provide IIT R (then the University of Roorkee) its own student publication with news, interviews and entertainment. The name is courtesy of the (then) Chief Warden of Govind Bhawan and our first patron, Prof C. P. Agarwal. 
With the pioneering efforts of the first editorial board and their colleagues at the Institute Computer Center, the first issue hit the shelves of the Govind Bhawan mess in 1994. What started as a fun little project managed to become the official student body of the campus in a few years. Watch Out! has remained the voice of IIT R ever since, and has evolved and expanded from a 7-member team to its present self.</div>
