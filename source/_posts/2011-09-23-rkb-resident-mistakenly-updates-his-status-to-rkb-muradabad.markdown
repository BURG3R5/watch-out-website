<strong>Roorkee</strong> The day when his fellow inmates were hailing the newly operational 1 Gbps internet by putting up status updates on the social networking site Facebook, a 3rd year B. Tech student at Radhakrishnan Bhawan, IIT Roorkee created an uproar in his hostel wing by putting up a controversial status.

The student, Peter Parker is an occupant of a posh Cautley-facing room on the seventh floor of the highrise. When this floor became the first to get 'sarkari' internet access amongst all the floors of the Bhawan, students blissfully logged in to their Facebook accounts to break this news to every nook-and-corner of the world. They posted congratulatory messages while those with Twitter accounts tweeted this development to Chetan Bhagat.

However, Mr. Parker, instead of going with the flow, updated his Facebook status as "RKB murdabad!!". As soon as this status went online, it flared up tensions in the nearby rooms on the seventh floor. Patriotic students forcibly took him out of his room and administered him a generous GPL amidst slogans like "Inquilaab Zindabaad!!" and "Anna Hazare amar rahe!!". As this news-flash trickled down the floors of the Bhawan, more inmates joined the commotion, resulting in a 400 people-strong mob. The grand open-for-all GPL ceremony continued for another 20 minutes when a mysterious sage-like old man came out of nowhere, appealed for peace, and disappeared. Suddenly, there was calm, and it appeared as if the students had been influenced by the hermit's aura. Afterwards no untoward incidents were reported. Later some students argued he was none other than the Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, who had tried to guise himself in a Batman robe.

Meanwhile, the IIT Roorkee administration is contemplating to slap a 10-marks discipline fine on the accused (victim) student.
