<em>I was staring out the window, distracted from the unenviable task of dimensioning a long-forgotten machine. As I stared at a shadow moving along the ground (yes, that's how unenviable my task was), I noticed the shadows that had been previously hidden, being revealed by its motion. That's when I realized how most shadows stayed hidden and unnoticed within all the other shadows. 
</em>
<em>
And that's when my eternally crazy, philosophy-tinted mind made a rather far-fetched link to my own ignorance, and my ignorance of my own ignorance. The madman within me screamed at me to express the revelation. I quelled the insanity.
He ultimately won, though.
</em>
<p>
A city of blissful mortals and mournful souls<br/>
Within weary walls, and the winter cold.<br/>
Under a gloomy sun behind a misty veil,<br/>
In an year of a single night and a single day.<br/>
</p>

<p> 
Voices of the unquenchable soul, unheard<br/>
In the peaceful silence of existence.<br/> 
Captured and bound by earthly vows,<br/>
Driven to despair by an unseen foe.<br/>
</p>

<p>
A musty past, scrolls of seekers lost<br/>
The only remnants of a fading quest.<br/>
As a forgotten god, a bottomless well,<br/>
Hollow and unfulfilled it shall be.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Puppets dancing to self made strings,<br/>
Without a master, without a cause.<br/>
Echoes of music from beyond the veil<br/>
Resonate within their empty souls.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
Illusion of conviction, conjured<br/>
By the shadowy trickster of guile.<br/>
He who pulled the greatest trick of all<br/>
Lies shrouded in the shadow of the cloud.<br/>
</p>
<p> 
The future holds the answer,<br/>
To the unasked question,<br/>
Will lightning strike?<br/>
Or will nighttime fall?<br/>
</p>
