<em>I was staring out the window, distracted from the unenviable task of dimensioning a long-forgotten machine. As I stared at a shadow moving along the ground (yes, that's how unenviable my task was), I noticed the shadows that had been previously hidden, being revealed by its motion. That's when I realized how most shadows stayed hidden and unnoticed within all the other shadows. 

And that's when my eternally crazy, philosophy-tinted mind made a rather far-fetched link to my own ignorance, and my ignorance of my own ignorance. The madman within me screamed at me to express the revelation. I quelled the insanity.
He ultimately won, though.
</em>
A city of blissful mortals and mournful souls
Within weary walls, and the winter cold.
Under a gloomy sun behind a misty veil,
In an year of a single night and a single day.
 
Voices of the unquenchable soul, unheard
In the peaceful silence of existence. 
Captured and bound by earthly vows,
Driven to despair by an unseen foe.
 
A musty past, scrolls of seekers lost
The only remnants of a fading quest.
As a forgotten god, a bottomless well,
Hollow and unfulfilled it shall be.
 
Puppets dancing to self made strings,
Without a master, without a cause.
Echoes of music from beyond the veil
Resonate within their empty souls.
 
Illusion of conviction, conjured
By the shadowy trickster of guile.
He who pulled the greatest trick of all
Lies shrouded in the shadow of the cloud.
 
The future holds the answer,
To the unasked question,
Will lightning strike?
Or will nighttime fall?
